                    <span className="text-[25px]">We</span>, the Carmelites of Mary Immaculate, after the example
                    of our founder Saint Kuriakose Elias Chavara, consider
                    education as integral formation of the human person for the
                    fulfillment	of	his/her	individual	and		social	responsibilities.
                    <br />
                    Our Educational endeavours aim at forming leaders who  are
                    intellectually competent, spiritually mature, morally  upright,
                    psychologically integrated, physically healthy and socially
                    acceptable; who will champion the cause of justice, love,
                    truth and peace and who are ever open to further growth.
                    The secret of the success of our educational institutions  is a
                    community of teachers who are committed to their   vocation,
                    professionally competent, morally upright, just and humane
                    in dealings, and who grow in the true vision of education.
                    We aspire towards creating a just human society where
                    dignity of the human person is respected, where unjust
                    structures are challenged, where our cultural heritage of
                    ahimsa, religious harmony and national integration is upheld,
                    and where the poor and the marginalized are specially taken
                    care of.
                    <br />
                    We have to reach out to the families, primarily of the
                    students, to assist them in their needs, to share in their joys
                    and sorrows, and to help them experience love and freedom
                    so that the students realize that our educational institutions
                    are on extension of their homes.
                    <br />
                    Our institutions are open to all students irrespective of  caste
                    and creed; they are accepted and cherished as they are and
                    are helped to grow in their cultural, social and religious
                    traditions. As they are privileged to be in our institutions, they
                    will also have the right to get acquainted with the person of
                    Jesus Christ and His gospel. Being institutions established by
                    and for a majority community based on religion, they will
                    give preference to Christians in admissions and appointments
                    and have a special  concern for the faith formation of the
                    Christian youth.
                    <br />
                    Our institutions have to be open to society at large by
                    making their resources available for the ongoing education
                    and non-formal teaching.
                    For the realization of this CMI goal of education, we expect
                    students, parents and teachers to share this vision and to
                    cooperate with us whole-heartedly.
